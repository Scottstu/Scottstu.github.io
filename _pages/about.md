My name is Scott Stubberfield and I have worked in the technology consulting and software development field for almost 25 years. Most of my career was spent working at Microsoft where I held many roles including consultant, program manager, technical specialist and product manager. 

Recently I have taken on a new role as an ecommerce operations manager for a small online business that has allowed me to continue to develop my consulting and software development skills while learning some new technologies. This work has allowed this business to grow and increase their efficiency while saving costs along the way.

    * Custom form for user signup / giveaway with results processed by Python automation
    * Custom FAQ page including ability to exclude/include sections and items by country
        * Used dynamic CSS, liquid and metaobjects
* Packing slip customization
* Theme upgrades
* Segment creation and marketing campaigns
* 3rd party shipping integrations with Shopify including Stallion Express and NetParcel which can include automation and tagging of orders
* Integration of your Shopify store with GitHub for granular change control

**Python:**
