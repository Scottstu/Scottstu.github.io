My name is Scott Stubberfield and I have worked in the technology consulting and software development field for almost 25 years. Most of my career was spent working at Microsoft where I held many roles including consultant, program manager, technical specialist and product manager. 

Recently I have taken on a new role that has allowed me to continue to develop my consulting and software development skills while learning some new technologies. 
This new role has allowed me to work on Shopify projects in the following areas:
* Basic store setup and configuration and initial integration with themes
* Theme customizations
    * Out of stock requests using metafields for variants to create custom ETA dates
    * Localization of enable entire site time to be customized by Country/Region
    * Custom form for user signup / giveaway with results processed by python automation
    * Custom FAQ page including ability to exclude/include sections and items by country
        * Used dynamic CSS, liquid and metaobjects
* Packing slip customization
* Theme upgrades
* Segment creation and marketing campaigns

I have also created several Python scripts that improved the automation of several processes:
* Automatic tagging of orders with tag to identify shipping parameters
* Automated processed of out of stock requests
* Customer creation and tagging of customers
* Setup and configuration of GitHub actions to execute all automation scripts

Outside of work I live in Georgetown, Ontario Canada and enjoy golfing, hockey and slo-pitch baseball. I volunteer my time coaching youth hockey as a non-parent coach.
